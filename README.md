# IOS-Application-Development
This is the IOS Application which uses Swift 4.
We have used the Maps Framework along with CoreMotion and other elements like PolyLine etc.
This can be used as a Personal assistant or a Campus Guide for students at Northern Illinois University to know more about the University.
There are two routes, a Short route which contains 10 campus buildings and a Long route which contains all 28 campus buildings of NIU. Both the routes let the user make changes to the list of buildings they want to visit. Also, selecting a building changes the View to a Detailed view of the building which describes some details about the building. Each detail view also contains a play, pause and stop button to let the user listen to the facts.
